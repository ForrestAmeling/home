          <h4>Leadership</h4>
          <p>As a manager, I oversee two teams of 11 software engineers. They handle backend development and support for data
          management. A typical work day involves collaborating with developers on new customer implementations, presenting sprint
          results to the CIO, and assisting support devs in investigating data transmission issues for specific customers.</p>

          <h4>Problem Solver</h4>
          <p>I started at Century working as a Developer 1 on the Support team. Regularly had to troubleshoot backend
            process to find
            the root cause. An example: Our PO process stopped due to an exceptions procedure flagging data at the header level. SQL batching failed on a NULL
            value with no header level data. I skipped the problematic data, fixed the exceptions procedure, and processed all
            customer POs.</p>

          <h4>SQL Development</h4>
          <p>I write SQL every day. Started writing SQL to scan tables, troubleshoot processes, and implement fixes.
            Then I moved to
            the Development team and started writing full SQL procedures new processes, and adding logic to existing
            procedures.
            These include performance improvements.</p>

          <h4>Proactive Skill Development</h4>
          <p>All coding experience has been self-taught. I am naturally curious, and always looking to enhance my skills.
          I have an engineering mindset. I tear code apart and build it back together to learn, improve, and
          understand.</p>

          <h4>Web design</h4>
          <p>For about 8 months, I managed the backend and frontend development teams. This gave me greater exposure
            to our frontend
            code built on C3, Angular, and Typescript. I also started learning on the frontend framework of
            JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS. I still code websites in my personal time.</p>

          <h4>EDI</h4>
          <p>As a logistics company we work with a lot of transportation companies and EDI is the current standard. A
            lot of the data
            we ingest or send comes in EDI format. I have experience supporting and developing programs to ingest or
            write 214, 856,
            315, 309, 350/355, 850/860 EDI files.</p>

          <h4>API</h4>
          <p>Some of our customers send us their data over API. I have helped manage the work and create documentation

            and ingestion of the JSON data.</p>
