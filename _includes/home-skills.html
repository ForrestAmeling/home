          <h4>Leadership</h4>
          <p>I manage 2 teams of 11 software engineers. These teams develop new implementations in our backend and
            support all of the
            data coming into and out of the database. An example of a work day might be working with a developer on a
            new customers
            implementation, delivering a report to the CIO on the prior sprints results, while also helping
            investigate an issue
            with a support dev on why certain data isn't sending for a customer.</p>

          <h4>Problem Solver</h4>
          <p>I started at Century working as a Developer 1 on the Support team. Regularly had to troubleshoot backend
            process to find
            the root cause. An example I have is one day out PO process stopped working. We were no longer ingesting
            POs for any
            customer. The root cause was an exceptions procedure flagged the data not to be consumed at only the
            header level. SQL
            was trying to batch and it was failing on a NULL value because the detail level had no header level data.
            I skipped the
            data that was causing the error, correct the exceptions procedure to update all levels, and we processed
            all customer
            POs.</p>

          <h4>SQL Development</h4>
          <p>I write SQL every day. Started writing SQL to scan tables, troubleshoot processes, and implement fixes.
            Then I moved to
            the Development team and started writing full SQL procedures new processes, and adding logic to existing
            procedures.
            These include performance improvements.</p>

          <h4>Proactive Skill Development</h4>
          All coding experience has been self-taught. I am naturally curious, and always looking to enhance my skills.
          I have an engineering mindset. I tear code apart and build it back together to learn, improve, and
          understand.

          <h4>Web design</h4>
          <p>For about 8 months, I managed the backend and frontend development teams. This gave me greater exposure
            to our frontend
            code built on C3, Angular, and Typescript. I also started learning on the frontend framework of
            JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS. I still code websites in my personal time.</p>

          <h4>EDI</h4>
          <p>As a logistics company we work with a lot of transportation companies and EDI is the current standard. A
            lot of the data
            we ingest or send comes in EDI format. I have experience supporting and developing programs to ingest or
            write 214, 856,
            315, 309, 350/355, 850/860 EDI files.</p>

          <h4>API</h4>
          <p>Some of our customers send us their data over API. I have helped manage the work and create documentation

            and ingestion of the JSON data.</p>
