In a span of just three years and ten months, I embarked on a remarkable journey that took me from a Developer 1 position on the support team to managing both the backend and front-end development teams. Through effective communication and a focus on customer and business needs, I defied conventional expectations, proving that success isn't solely determined by technical prowess. Join me as I share my inspiring story of growth, leadership, and the power of perseverance.

From Developer 1 to Engineering Manager:
When I initially joined Century Distribution Systems as a Developer 1, I possessed limited experience with SQL. However, fueled by my passion for learning and a strong work ethic, I quickly absorbed knowledge and honed my technical skills. My dedication paid off as I steadily advanced within the organization, assuming roles such as Developer II and Delivery Development Team Lead. Throughout these positions, I consistently demonstrated technical leadership, guiding my colleagues to maintain high software quality standards and fostering an environment conducive to growth and success.

The Company Restructuring and the Path to Management:
During a pivotal period, the company underwent a significant restructuring, redefining roles and responsibilities. It was at this juncture that I was entrusted with the responsibility of managing the backend development team and the frontend development team. About 10 months later the company restructured again, where I found myself leading the very team I started with in the backend support team aswell as the backend development team. While the restructuring presented its share of challenges, I approached it as an opportunity to prove my abilities and contribute to the company's success. With a relentless focus on communication, I ensured a smooth transition and built a cohesive and motivated team.

Leveraging Technical Background for Team Development:
As an Engineering Manager, my technical background proved invaluable in coaching and developing my team members. While I may not have been the most technically proficient individual on the team, I compensated by working diligently, continuously expanding my knowledge, and staying abreast of industry trends. By combining my technical acumen with effective communication, I created an environment where ideas flowed freely, collaboration thrived, and each team member felt empowered to contribute their best.

The Power of Agile Methodologies:
One of the key factors that contributed to my team's success was the adoption of Scrum and Agile methodologies. Embracing the principles of agility, we became adept at navigating the dynamic landscape of projects, adapting to changes, and delivering value to our customers. Through daily scrum meetings, we prioritized and refined work, ensuring alignment with business objectives and fostering a sense of ownership among team members. This iterative approach not only enhanced our productivity but also allowed us to provide predictable delivery and exceed customer expectations.

Conclusion:
My journey from a Developer 1 on the support team to managing both backend and front-end development teams has been a testament to the power of determination, effective communication, and a customer-centric mindset. I've learned that technical proficiency alone is not the sole indicator of success; rather, it is the ability to inspire and lead a team towards a common goal that truly defines exceptional leadership. As I continue to iterate on process improvements and leverage my technical background, I am excited for the future, where I can continue building high-performing teams and ensuring customer satisfaction in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
